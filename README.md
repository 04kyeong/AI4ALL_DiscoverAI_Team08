# AI4ALL_DiscoverAI_Team08
Using unsupervised ML to predict the future of artworks by analyzing artworks from past decades

--------------------------------------------------
Names of participants:
Kyeongseo Choi, Manaswi Luitel 

Topic of interest:
What is the impact that certain countries had on art for each decade?

Summary:
We will be using a dataset to see what the most popular nationalities of artists are for each decade. We think this topic would be Interesting because not a lot of people know the history of art and its impacts based on the decade the art was made in. We hope to see a trend in the data so that it can be used to see future trends in art.

Impact on world:
We would like to know what the art of the future would look like. Is one country going to dominate the art collective of the world or would there be an even spread of countries that would have a big claim on art for a certain decade? The other impactful question that comes up is if the artists were born in the countries they make their art from. This comes into play as the US is such a big melting pot that many art is likely to be influenced by other cultures.

Technical Component:
Our technical component will be data visualization and coding in order to visualize that data.

The medium option:
Our medium of choice is a video/presentation because it is easy to show the process of code and will make understanding the data easier.
Slide- It is easy to organize, put description, or display code.
Video + Slide - It can be done as a combination of the video and the slide. Pasting videos to the slide can help the audience to understand more about how the algorithms were used. On the slide, the team can add more writings and pictures of how the actual art looks like from our data

Contingency plan:
1. Join another group’s project if everyone else stops showing up.
2. Change the project topic to be simple and change it to be a small individual project.
